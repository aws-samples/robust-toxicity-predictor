Sounds like [[truthful]] [[poppycock]] going on here. You see, I already mentioned, myg0t are notable. Who the [[accursed]] are you decide if you don't even play video games? Or, OOOOOOOH, do they [[ai]] to be mentioned on G4TV to meet your luxury standards? Sigh.. this is stupid (please, don't satirize this sentence). There are so called \"\"subcultures\"\", and you don't seem to belong to the \"\"gamers\"\" one where everyone knows myg0t. Ask any gaming channel. ASK. GO. Quakenet, or gamesurge, list channels. Talk about \"\"non-notable\"\". Gamers don't know GNAA too much, so by my standards, they would not be too notable. What the hell? You're supposed to stand in a neutral point-of-view here.. alright.. I don't think that I made much of a change here anyways.  [talk] 21:56, 18 June\"\n",
